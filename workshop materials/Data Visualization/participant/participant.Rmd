# Data Visualization using **`ggplot2`** 

**`ggplot2`** is a plotting package that makes it simple to create complex plots
from data in a data frame. It provides a more programmatic interface for
specifying what variables to plot, how they are displayed, and general visual
properties. Therefore, we only need minimal changes if the underlying data 
change or if we decide to change from a bar plot to a scatter plot. This helps 
in creating publication quality plots with minimal amounts of adjustments and 
tweaking.

Packages in `R` are basically sets of additional functions that let you do more
stuff. The functions we've been using so far, like `str()` or `mean()`,
come built into `R`; packages give you access to more of them. Before you use a
package for the first time you need to install it on your machine, and then you
should import it in every subsequent `R` session when you need it. You should
already have installed the **`tidyverse`** package. This is an
"umbrella-package" that installs several packages useful for data analysis which
work together well such as **`tidyr`**, **`dplyr`**, **`ggplot2`**, 
**`readr`**, **`forcats`**, etc.

The **`tidyverse`** package tries to address common issues that arise when
doing data analysis with some of the functions that come with `R`. 

1. The `tidyverse` solves complex problems by combining many simple pieces.

> No matter how complex and polished the individual operations are, 
> it is often the quality of the glue that most directly determines 
> the power of the system.
> - Hal Abelson

2. The `tidyverse` is written for people to read! 

> Computer efficiency is a secondary concern because the 
> bottleneck in most data analysis is thinking time, not computing time.
> - Hadley Wickham

If we haven't already done so, we can type `install.packages("tidyverse")` 
straight into the console. In fact, it's better to write this in the console 
than in our script for any package, as there's no need to re-install packages 
every time we run the script.

Then, to load the package type:

```{r, message = FALSE}
## load the tidyverse packages
library(tidyverse)
```

To learn more about **`ggplot2`** after the workshop, you may want
to check out this
[**`ggplot2`** reference website (link)](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/) 
and this [handy cheatsheet on **`ggplot2`** (link)](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf).

# Data for the Workshop 

We have seen in our previous lesson that when building or importing a data 
frame, the columns that contain characters (i.e., text) are coerced 
(=converted) into the `factor` data type. We had to set **`stringsAsFactors`** 
to **`FALSE`** to avoid this hidden argument to convert our data type. 

This time we will use the **`readr`** package (from the `tidyverse`) to read in 
the data and avoid having to set **`stringsAsFactors`** to **`FALSE`**

We'll read in our data using the `read_csv()` function instead of the 
`read.csv()` function we used in the _Introduction to `R`_ workshop.

```{r, results = 'hide'}
surveys <- read_csv("data/surveys.csv")
```

You will see the message `Parsed with column specification`, followed by each 
column name and its data type. When you execute `read_csv` on a data file, it 
looks through the first 1000 rows of each column and guesses the data type for 
each column as it reads it into `R`. For example, in this dataset, `read_csv` 
reads `weight` as `col_double` (a numeric data type), and `species` as 
`col_character`. 

```{r, results = 'hide'}
## inspect the data
str(surveys)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## preview the data
View(surveys)
```

Notice that the class of the data is now `tbl_df`

This is referred to as a "tibble". Tibbles tweak some of the behaviors of the 
data frame objects we introduced in the previous workshop. The data structure is
very similar to a data frame, so for our purposes the only differences are that:

1. In addition to displaying the data type of each column under its name, it
   only prints the first few rows of data and only as many columns as fit on one
   screen.
2. Columns of class `character` are never converted into factors.


## Plotting with **`ggplot2`**

`ggplot2` functions like data in the 'long' format, i.e., a column for every 
dimension, and a row for every observation. There are other data formats, which 
we will discuss in the _Data Wrangling in `R`_ workshop, as well as how to 
covert from one data format to another. Well-structured data will save you 
lots of time when making figures with `ggplot2` and when working in `R`!

`ggplot()` graphics are built step by step by adding new elements. Adding layers 
in this fashion allows for extensive flexibility and customization of plots.

To build a `ggplot()`, we will use the following basic template that can be used 
for different types of plots:

`ggplot(data = <DATA>, mapping = aes(<VARIABLE MAPPINGS>)) +  <GEOM_FUNCTION>()`

Let's go through this step by step!  

1. Use the `ggplot()` function and bind the plot to a specific data frame using 
the `data` argument

```{r, results = 'hold'}
ggplot(data = surveys) 
## Creates a blank ggplot(), referencing the surveys dataset
```

2. Define a mapping (using the aesthetic (`aes`) function), by selecting the 
variables to be plotted and specifying how to present them in the graph, e.g. as
x/y positions or characteristics such as size, shape, color, etc.

```{r, results = 'hold'}
ggplot(data = surveys, 
       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))
## Creates a blank ggplot(), with the variables mapped to the x- and y-axis
## ggplot() knows where the variables live, since you have defined the data to use
```

3. Add 'geoms' -- graphical representations of the data in the plot (points,
  lines, bars). **`ggplot2`** offers many different geoms; we will use some 
  common ones today, including:
  
      * `geom_point()` for scatter plots, dot plots, etc.
      * `geom_boxplot()` for boxplots   
      * `geom_bar()` for bar charts 
      * `geom_line()` for trend lines, time series, etc.  

To add a geom to the plot use the `+` operator. Because we have two continuous 
variables in the data, let's use `geom_point()` first:

```{r, results = 'hold'}
ggplot(data = surveys, 
       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point()
 ## Adds a point for each row (observation) in the data  
```

You can think of the `+` sign as adding layers to the plot. 
Each `+` sign must be placed at the end of the line containing the *previous* 
layer. If, instead, the `+` sign is added at the beginning of the line 
containing the new layer, **`ggplot2`** will not add the new layer and will 
return an error message.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# This is the correct syntax for adding layers
surveys_plot +
  geom_point()

# This will not add the new layer and will return an error message
surveys_plot
  + geom_point()
```


## Building Plots Iteratively 

Building plots with **`ggplot2`** is typically an iterative process. We start by
defining the dataset we'll use, lay out the axes, and choose a geom:

```{r}
ggplot(data = surveys, 
       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point()
```

Then, we start modifying this plot to extract more information from it. For
instance, we can add transparency (`alpha`) to the points, to avoid 
overplotting:

```{r, results = 'hold'}
ggplot(data = surveys, 
       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
    ## alpha reduces the opacity of the points 
    ## 0 is fully transparent
    ## 1 is the original opacity
```

We can also add colors for all the points:

```{r}
ggplot(data = surveys, 
       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.1, color = "blue")
```


### Challenge 1

`geom_point` also accepts aesthetics of size and shape. 
The size of a point is its width in mm. The shape of a point has five 
different options for plotting:  

* an integer [0, 25] of defined plotting characters -- same as base `R`
* the name of the shape in quotations (e.g. "circle open" or "diamond filled")
* a single character, to use that character as a plotting symbol
* a "." to draw the smallest point that is visible -- typically 1 pixel
* an NA, to draw nothing

Reference for shapes in integers and characters:  
https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html  

> Modify the previous code chunk to assign one of these aesthetics to the 
> `geom_point` aspect of your plot. What happened? 

```{r}
## Your ggplot code to answer the challenge goes here!


```


## Piping Data In  

Because **`ggplot2`** lives in the `tidyverse`, it is expected to work well with 
other packages in the `tidyverse`. Because of this, the first argument to 
creating a `ggplot()` is the dataset you wish to be working with. The pipe 
operator sends the output of one function directly into the next function,
which is useful when you need to do many things to the same dataset. Since the 
dataset we wish to use is the first argument to `ggplot()`, we can use the pipe 
operator to pipe the data into the `ggplot()` function!  

Pipes in `R` look like `%>%` and are made available via the **`magrittr`** 
package, installed automatically with the **`tidyverse`**. If you use RStudio, 
you can type the pipe with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if
you have a PC or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a
Mac.

This would instead look like this:  

```{r}
surveys %>%  
  ## data to be used in the ggplot  
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) + 
  ## uses the data piped in as the first arguement to ggplot() 
    geom_point(alpha = 0.1, color = "blue")
```

Once we pipe the data in, the first argument becomes the `mapping` of the 
aesthetics. Technically, we are using the name of this argument, which is why it
looks like:  

`mapping = aes(<VARIABLES>)`

When we pipe our data in, the first argument then becomes this `mapping` 
argument. 

## Assigning More Variables to Aesthetics 

Or to color each species in the plot differently, you could use a vector as an
input to the argument **color**. **`ggplot2`** will provide a different color 
corresponding to different values in the vector. Here is an example where we 
color with **`species_id`**:

```{r}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.1, aes(color = species_id)) 

```

**Note:** When specifying an `alpha` for a scatterplot, it automatically uses 
that __same__ `alpha` in the legend. To remedy this you can add:  

```
guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1)))
```
to your plot. This customizes the legend appearance, similar to what we will 
see in the customization section. 

We can also specify the colors directly inside the mapping provided in the 
`ggplot()` function. This will be seen by **any** geom layers and the mapping 
will be determined by the x- and y-axis set up in `aes()`.

```{r}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length, color = species_id)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
```

Notice that we can change the geom layer and colors will be still determined by
**`species_id`**


### Local Aesthetics versus Global Aesthetics 

When you define aesthetics in the `ggplot()` function, those mappings hold for
**every** aspect of your plot. 

For example, if you chose to add a trend line to your plot of weight versus 
hindfoot length, you would get different lines depending on where you define 
your color aesthetics. 

**Globally** 

```{r, warning = FALSE, results = 'hold'}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length, color = species_id)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) + 
  geom_smooth()
  ## trend line for each species_id -- because color is defined globally
```

**Locally**  

```{r, warning = FALSE, results = 'hold'}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = species_id), alpha = 0.1) + 
  geom_smooth()
  ## one trend line -- no color defined globally
```


### Challenge 2

> Part 1: 
> Inspect the `geom_point` help file to see what other aesthetics are available. 
> Map a new variable from the dataset to another aesthetic in your plot. 
> What happened? 
> Does the aesthetic change if you use a continuous variable versus a 
> categorical/discrete variable?

## Your ggplot() code for the challenge goes here!


```

> Part 2:
> Use what you just learned to create a scatter plot of `weight` over
> `plot_id` with data from different plot types being showed in different 
> colors. Is this a good way to show this type of data?

```{r}
## Your ggplot() code for the challenge goes here!


```


# Boxplots & Violin Plots

We can use boxplots to visualize the distribution of weight within each species:

```{r}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

By adding points to boxplot, we can have a better idea of the number of
measurements and their distribution:

```{r, results = 'hold'}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
    geom_boxplot(alpha = 0) + 
    ## alpha = 0 eliminates the black (outlier) points, so they're not plotted twice
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2, color = "tomato")
    ## alpha = 0.2 decreases the opacity of the points, to not be too busy
```

> Notice how the boxplot layer is behind the jitter layer? What would you 
> change in the code to put the boxplot in front of the points?


### Challenge 3

> Part 1: 
> Boxplots are useful summaries, but hide the *shape* of the distribution. For
> example, if the distribution is bimodal, we would not see it in a boxplot. 
> A superior density plot is the violin plot, where the shape 
> (of the density of points) is drawn.
>
> Replace the box plot with a violin plot. For help see `geom_violin()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
##  Start with the boxplot we created:
ggplot(data = surveys, mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, color = "tomato")

##  1. Replace the boxplot with a violin plot. For help, see geom_violin().


```

> Part 2:
> So far, we've looked at the distribution of weight within species. Let's try 
> making a new plot to explore the distribution of another variable within each 
> species.
>
> Create a boxplot for `hindfoot_length`. Overlay the boxplot layer on a jitter
> layer to show actual measurements.

```{r}
##  First: create boxplot for hindfoot_length` overlaid on a jitter layer.

```

> Now, add color to the data points on your boxplot according to the plot from 
> which the sample was taken (`plot_id`).
>
> *Hint:* Check the class for `plot_id`. If `plot_id` was a character instead, 
> how would the graph be different?  

```{r}
## Next: add color to the data points on your boxplot according to the
## plot from which the sample was taken (plot_id).


## Hint: Check the class for plot_id`. If plot_id was a character instead, 
## how would the graph be different? 

```


# Plotting Single Variables -- Quantitative & Categorical  

## Distribution Plots 

If we wish to visualize the distribution of a single quantitative variable, our 
plot changes a bit. Unfortunately, the `geom_violin()` function only accepts 
groups, so we cannot make a violin plot with no groups. Darn it!  

But, a violin is simply a density plot that's been reflected across the y-axis. 
So, we could likely suffice with a density plot.  

To visualize the distribution of rodent weights we could aggregate over all 
species, years, plots, etc. and produce a single density plot:  


```{r}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight)) + 
  geom_density()
  
```

The default is an empty density plot, which is largely unsatisfying. By adding 
a `fill = <COLOR>` argument to `geom_density()` we can produce a nicer looking 
plot:  

```{r}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight)) + 
  geom_density(fill = "sky blue")
  
```

Another frequently used plot for a single quantitative variable is the 
histogram. The same plot as above can be recreated using `geom_histogram()` 
instead of `geom_density()`. However, when you use `geom_histogram()` it gives 
you a warning. 

> What warning do you get and why?
> Do you get an error like this when you use `hist()` in base `R`? 

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "sky blue")
  
```

I was once told that the idea behind a good histogram was to make the plot look 
as smooth as possible -- think trying to resemble the continuous shape of the 
density plot.  


### Challenge 4 

> Use the `bins` argument to play around with the number of bins in your 
> histogram. Compare your chosen number of bins with your neighbors! 


## Bar Charts  

At first glimpse, you would think that a bar plot would be simple to create, but
bar plots reveal a subtle nuance of the plots we have created thus far. The 
following bar chart displays the total number of rodents in the `surveys` 
dataset, grouped by their species ID. 

```{r}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

The x-axis displays the levels of `species_id`, a variable in the 
`surveys` dataset. On the y-axis `count` is displayed, but `count` is 
**not** a variable in our dataset! Where did `count` come from? Graphs, such as
the scatterplots, display the raw values of your data. Other graphs, like bar 
charts and boxplots, calculate new values (from your data) to plot. 

* Bar charts and histograms bin your data and then plot the number of 
observations that fall in each bin.  

* Boxplots find summaries of your data (min, max, quantiles, median) and plot 
those summaries in a tidy box, with "outliers" (data over 1.5*IQR from min/max)
plotted as points.  

* Smoothers (as used in `geom_smooth`) fit a model to your data (you can 
specify, but we used the `gam` default) and then plot the predictions from 
that model (with associated confidence intervals).  


To calculate each of these summaries of the data, `R` uses a different 
statistical transformation, or *stat* for short. With a bar chart this looks 
like the following process:  

1. `geom_bar` first looks at the entire data frame  
2. `geom_bar` then transforms the data using the `count` statistic  
3. the `count` statistic returns a data frame with the number of observations 
(rows) associated with each level of `species_id`  
4. `geom_bar` uses this summary data frame, to build the plot -- levels of 
`species_id` are plotted on the x-axis and `count` is plotted on the y-axis  

Generally, you can use geoms and stats interchangeably. This is because every 
geom has a default stat and visa versa. For example, the following code produces
the same output as above:  

```{r}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id)) + 
  stat_count()
```

If you so wish you could override the default stat for that geom. For example, 
if you wanted to plot a bar chart of proportions you would use the following 
code to override the `count` stat:  

```{r}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = ..prop.., group = 1))
```


### Challenge 5 

> Why do we need to set `group = 1` in the above proportion bar chart? 
> In other words, what is wrong with the plot below?  

```{r}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = ..prop..))
```


## Colored and/or Stacked Bar Charts  

Another piece of visual appeal to creating a bar chart is the ability to use 
colors to differentiate the different groups, or to plot two different variables
in one bar chart (stacked bar chart). Let's start with adding color to our bar
chart.  

### Coloring Bars 

As we saw before, to add a color aesthetic to the plot we need to map it to a 
variable. However, if we use the `color` option that we used before we get a 
slightly unsatisfying result.  

```{r}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id, color = species_id)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

We notice that the color only appears in the outline of the bars. For a bar 
chart, the aesthetic that we are interested in is the `fill` of the bars.  


### Challenge 6 

> Change the above code so that each bar is filled with a different color. 


## Stacking Bars 

Now suppose you are interested in whether the number of rodents in each species 
captured differs by sex. This would require for you to create a bar plot with 
two categorical variables. You have two options:  

1. each of the bars for sex could be stacked within a species *OR* 
2. the bars for sex could be side-by-side within a species  

Let's see how the two approaches differ. To stack bars of a second categorical 
variable we would instead use this second categorical variable as the `fill` of
the bars. Run these two lines of code and see how they differ. 

```{r, results = "hold"}
surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id, fill = sex)) + 
  geom_bar()

surveys %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species_id, fill = sex)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

In the first plot, the position was chosen automatically, but in the second plot
the `position` argument was made explicit. What changes did this make in the 
plots? 


# Time-series Data

Let's calculate number of counts per year for each genus. 

*What you will see in Data Wrangling:* First we need to group the data and count 
records within each group!  

```{r}
yearly_counts <- surveys %>%
  count(year, genus) 
 ## counts the number of observations (rows) for each year, genus combination
```

Time series data can be visualized as a line plot with years on the x-axis and 
counts on the y-axis: 

```{r}
yearly_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n)) +
     geom_line()
```

Unfortunately, this does not work because we plotted data for all the genera
together. We need to tell `ggplot()` to draw a line for each genus by modifying
the aesthetic function to include `group = genus`:

```{r}
yearly_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, group = genus)) +
    geom_line()
```

Unfortunately, we can't tell what line corresponds to which genus. We will be 
able to distinguish genera in the plot if we add colors (using `color` also 
automatically groups the data):

```{r}
yearly_counts %>% 
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = genus)) +
    geom_line()
```

**Note:** When specifying the color for a line graph, you can use either the 
`color = <VARIABLE>` argument or the `group = <VARIABLE>` argument. Both do the 
same grouping of observations!


## Faceting

**`ggplot2`** has a special technique called *faceting* that allows the user to 
split one plot into multiple plots based on a categorical variable included in 
the dataset. 

There are two types of `facet` functions:

* `facet_wrap()` arranges a one-dimensional sequence of panels to allow them to 
cleanly fit on one page -- used for one variable
* `facet_grid()` allows you to form a matrix of rows and columns of panels --
used for two variables  

Both geometries allow to to specify faceting variables specified within the 
`vars()` function. The `vars()` function looks at the categorical variable you 
provide it with and outputs the unique levels (values) of that variable. 

This looks like: `facet_wrap(facets = vars(facet_variable))` or 
`facet_grid(rows = vars(row_variable), cols = vars(col_variable))`. 

Let's start by using `facet_wrap()` to make a time series plot for each species:

```{r}
yearly_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_wrap(facets = vars(genus))
```

Now we would like to split the line in each plot by the sex of the rodent 
captured. To do that we need to make counts in the data frame grouped by `year`,
`species_id`, and `sex`:

```{r}
yearly_sex_counts <- surveys %>%
  count(year, species_id, sex)
## counts the number of observations (rows) for each year, species, sex combination
```

We can now make the faceted plot by splitting further by sex using `color` 
(within each panel):

```{r}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_wrap(facets =  vars(species_id))
```

You can also organize the panels only by rows (or only by columns), using the 
optional `nrow` and `ncol` arguments:

```{r, fig.height = 8.5, fig.width = 8, results = 'hold'}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(vars(species_id), ncol = 1)
  # One column, facet by rows
```

```{r, fig.width = 9.5, fig.height = 5, results = 'hold'}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_wrap(vars(species_id), nrow = 1)
  # One row, facet by columns
```

Now let's use `facet_grid()` to control how panels are organised by both rows 
and columns:

```{r, fig.width = 9.5}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_grid(rows = vars(sex), cols =  vars(species_id))
```

**Note:** 
In earlier versions of **`ggplot2`** you need to use an interface using formulas 
to specify how plots are faceted (and this is still supported in new versions). 
The equivalent syntax is:

```r
# facet wrap
facet_wrap(vars(genus))    # new
facet_wrap(~ genus)        # old

# grid on both rows and columns
facet_grid(rows = vars(genus), cols = vars(sex))   # new
facet_grid(genus ~ sex)                            # old

```{r}
## To get you started:  
yearly_species_weight <- surveys %>% 
  group_by(year, species_id) %>%
  ## Variables to group by!
  summarize(avg_weight = mean(weight))

# **`ggplot2`** Themes

Usually plots with white background look more readable when printed. 
Every single component of a `ggplot()` graph can be customized using the generic 
`theme()` function, as we will see below. However, there are pre-loaded themes 
available that change the overall appearance of the graph without much effort. 

For example, we can change our previous graph to have a simpler white background 
using the `theme_bw()` function:

```{r}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
 ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
     geom_line() +
     facet_wrap(vars(species_id)) +
     theme_bw()
```

In addition to `theme_bw()`, which changes the plot background to white, 
**`ggplot2`**comes with several other themes which can be useful to quickly 
change the look of your visualization. The complete list of themes is available
at <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html>. `theme_minimal()` and
`theme_light()` are popular, and `theme_void()` can be useful as a starting
point to create a new hand-crafted theme.

The
[ggthemes](https://jrnold.github.io/ggthemes/reference/index.html) package
provides a wide variety of options.

# Customization

Take a look at the [**`ggplot2`** cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf), 
and think of ways you could improve the plot.

## Plot Labels 

Now, let's change names of axes to something more informative than 'year'
and 'n' and add a title to the figure. Label customizations are done using the 
`labs()` function like so:

```{r}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(vars(species_id)) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Observed Genera Through Time",
       x = "Year of Observation",
       y = "Number of Rodents",  
       color = "Sex") 
```

**Tip: Wrapping Titles**    
Sometimes the titles we wish to have for our plots are longer than the space 
originally allotted. If you create a title and the text is running off the plot
you can add a `\n` inside your title to force a line break 
(`\n` stands for new line).  


## Label & Plot Fonts 

Note that it is also possible to change the fonts of your plots. If you are on
Windows, you may have to install
the [**`extrafont`** package](https://github.com/wch/extrafont), and follow the
instructions included in the README for this package.

In the last plot, the axes have more informative names, but their readability 
can be improved by increasing the font size. This can be done with the generic
`theme()` function. 

```{r, results = "hold"}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(vars(species_id)) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Observed Genera Through Time",
      x = "Year of Observation",
      y = "Number of Rodents", 
      color = "Sex") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
    ## sets ALL the text on the plot to be size 16
```

**Note:**  
`theme_bw()` is function for a **specific** theme and `theme()` is a
generic function for a **variety** of different themes!  

After our manipulations, you may notice that the values on the x-axis are still 
not properly readable. Let's swap the orientation of the labels, so the reader 
doesn't have to tilt their head when reading our plot! The `coord_flip()` 
function easily changes the x- and y-axis. 

```{r}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(vars(species_id)) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Observed Genera by \n Year of Observation",
      x = "",
      y = "Number of Rodents", 
      color = "Sex") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16)) + 
  coord_flip()
    
```

This definitely makes the reader tilt their head less! But, the text on the 
x-axis is a bit too large to separate the numbers. We can specify the text size 
for each element of the plot independently, if we so wish. This would look 
something like this:  

```{r}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(vars(species_id)) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Observed Genera by Year of Observation",
        x = "",
        y = "Number of Rodents", 
        color = "Sex") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10), 
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), 
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 12),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 16)) + 
  coord_flip()
    
```


## Legend Position

By default in `ggplot2` the legend is positioned on the right hand side. 
However, you are able to change the position of the legend to the left hand 
side, the top of the plot, or the bottom of the plot. 

This is done by adding a `legend.position` theme to the plot's `theme()`'s. 

```{r}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_wrap(vars(species_id)) +
    labs(title = "Observed Genera by Year of Observation by",
        x = "",
        y = "Number of Rodents", 
        color = "Sex") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10), 
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), 
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 14),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14), 
        legend.position = "top") + 
  coord_flip()
    
```


## Removing Grid Lines 

By default, the background of a `ggplot()` contains both minor and major 
gridlines. These can make the plot look a bit busy and difficult for the reader 
to follow. As you may have guessed, to remove these gridlines, we add another
theme to our plot. 

This looks like this:

```{r}
yearly_sex_counts %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(vars(species_id)) +
  labs(title = "Observed Genera by Year of Observation by",
      x = "",
      y = "Number of Rodents", 
      color = "Sex") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10), 
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), 
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 14),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14), 
        legend.position = "top", 
        ## New themes for the grid lines
        axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"),
        ## 
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(), 
        panel.background = element_blank()) + 
  coord_flip()
    
```

Let's break these options down!  

- The `axis.line` option declares what color the x- and y-axis lines should be. 
(Change it to a different color, if you don't believe me!)
- The `panel.grid.major` removes the major grid (the one associated with the 
ticks from the x- and y-axis).  
- The `panel.grid.minor` removes the minor grid (the one *between* the x- and 
y-axis ticks).  
- The `panel.border` removes the border around the plot.  
- The `panel.background` performs a similar action to `theme_bw()`, but it keeps 
the border around the facet labels.    


## Changing Colors 

The built in `ggplot()` color scheme may not be what you were looking for, but 
don't worry! There are many other color palettes available to use!  

You can change the colors used by `ggplot()` a few different ways.  

### Manual Specification 

Add the `scale_color_manual()` or `scale_fill_manual()` functions to your 
plot and directly specify the colors you want to use. You can either:  

- defining a vector of colors right there (e.g. `values = c("blue", "black", "red", "green")`)  

- creating a vector of colors and storing it in an object and calling it 
(see below)

```{r}
# A color deficient friendly palette with grey:
cbPalette_grey <- c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", 
                    "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")

# A color deficient friendly palette with black:
cbPalette_blk <- c("#000000", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", 
                   "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")

surveys %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = species_id, y = hindfoot_length, color = genus)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_color_manual(values = cbPalette_grey)
```

### Package Specification 

Install a package and use it's available color scales. Popular options 
include:  

- `RColorBrewer`: using `scale_fill_brewer()` or `scale_colour_brewer()` 

- `viridis`: using `scale_colour_viridis_d()` for discrete data, 
`scale_colour_viridis_c()` for continuous data, with an inside 
argument of `option = <COLOR>` for your chosen color scheme  

- `ggsci`: using `scale_color_<PALNAME>()` or `scale_fill_<PALNAME>()`, where
you specify the name of the palette you wish to use (e.g. `scale_color_aaas()`)

## Arranging and Exporting Plots

Faceting is a great tool for splitting one plot into multiple plots, but 
sometimes you may want to produce a single figure that contains multiple plots 
using different variables or even different data frames. The **`gridExtra`** 
package allows us to combine separate ggplots into a single figure using 
`grid.arrange()`:

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.width = 10, results = 'hold'}
library(gridExtra)

spp_weight_boxplot <- surveys %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = genus, y = weight)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_jitter(color = "tomato", width = 0.2, alpha = 0.1) + 
  scale_y_log10() +
  ## log (base 10) transforms the y-axis variable
  ## (helps to make the plot less skewed)
  labs(x = "", 
       ## removes the y-axis label
       y = expression(Log[10](Weight))) +
       ## Expression creates a mathematical expression in the axis label
       ## the [10] refers to the subscript next to Log
  coord_flip() + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), 
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12), 
        text = element_text(size = 16))

spp_count_plot <- yearly_counts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, color = genus)) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(x = "Year", 
       y = "Abundance", 
       color = "Genus") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(face = "bold", size = 12))
  ## To make your axis title boldface, this is what you need!

grid.arrange(spp_weight_boxplot, spp_count_plot, ncol = 2, widths = c(4, 6))
## nrow and ncol specify how many rows/columns you want the arranged plots to be in
## widths specify what proportion of the overall plotting area each plot takes up
```

In addition to the `ncol` and `nrow` arguments, used to make simple arrangements,
there are tools for [constructing more complex layouts](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/vignettes/arrangeGrob.html). 


For more assistance arranging plots with `grid.arrage()`. I find the following 
vignette **very** helpful! 

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/egg/vignettes/Ecosystem.html

# Exporting Plots 

After creating your plot, you can save it to a file in your favorite format. The
Export tab in the **Plot** pane in RStudio will save your plots at low 
resolution, which will not be accepted by many journals and will not scale well 
for posters. 

Instead, use the `ggsave()` function, which allows you easily change the 
dimension and resolution of your plot by adjusting the appropriate arguments:  

- `width` and `height`: adjust the total plot size in units ("in", "cm", or "mm")
  * If units are not specified, default is inches. 
- `dpi`: adjusts the plot resolution. This accepts a string or numeric input: 
    * "retina" (320)
    * "print" (300) 
    * "screen" (72)
    
Make sure you have the `fig/` folder in your working directory.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_plot <- ggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts, 
                  mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
              geom_line() +
              facet_wrap(vars(species_id)) +
              labs(title = "Observed genera through time",
                    x = "Year of observation",
                    y = "Number of individuals") +
              theme_bw() +
              coord_flip() + 
              theme(axis.text.y = element_text(colour = "grey20", size = 12),
                    axis.text.y = element_text(colour = "grey20", size = 12),
                    text = element_text(size = 16))

ggsave("fig/yearly_sex_counts.png", my_plot, width = 15, height = 10)

# This also works for grid.arrange() plots
combo_plot <- grid.arrange(spp_weight_boxplot, spp_count_plot, 
                           ncol = 2, widths = c(4, 6))

ggsave("fig/combo_plot_abun_weight.png", combo_plot, width = 10, dpi = 300)
```

> Note: 
> The parameters `width` and `height` also determine the font size in the 
> saved plot.


# Tips for Creating Visually Appealing Data Visualizations 

![](images/glamour_of_graphics.JPG)

One of my favorite references when I am creating plots are the slides from Will 
Chase's presentation at the 2020 RStudio Conference [(link)](https://www.williamrchase.com/slides/assets/player/KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html#0). 
Will is a graphic designer and lays out some interesting "best practices" for 
creating graphics that we can explore. His suggestions are for three components 
of the plot: layout, typography, and color. Here are some big take-aways that I 
use when I create a plot!  

- Titles should be top-left aligned (usually). 

![](images/alignment.JPG)

- Don't make people tilt their head!

![](images/tilt.JPG)

- Don't use borders!

- Remove grids and lighten as much as possible -- don't use minor grid lines. 

![](images/grids.JPG)

- Legends suck, so find clever ways to eliminate them. 

![](images/legend.JPG)

- White space is like garlic; take the amount you think you need and triple it.  

- Fonts matter!  

![](images/fonts.JPG)

- Colors are hard, so think about them carefully!
