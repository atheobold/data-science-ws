# Abstract 

Over the last 20 years, statistics preparation has become vital for a
broad range of scientific fields, and statistics coursework has been readily 
incorporated into undergraduate and graduate programs. However, a gap remains 
between the computational skills taught in statistics service courses and those
required for the use of statistics in scientific research. Ten years after the 
publication of "Computing in the Statistics Curriculum," the nature of 
statistics continues to change, and computing skills are more necessary than 
ever for modern scientific researchers. In this paper, we describe research on 
the design and implementation of a suite of data science workshops for 
environmental science graduate students, providing students with the skills 
necessary to retrieve, view, wrangle, visualize, and analyze their data using 
reproducible tools. These workshops help to bridge the gap between the computing
skills necessary for scientific research and the computing skills with which
students leave their statistics service courses. Moreover, though
targeted to environmental science graduate students, these workshops are open to
the larger academic community. As such, they promote the continued learning of 
the computational tools necessary for working with data, and provide resources
for incorporating data science into the classroom.
